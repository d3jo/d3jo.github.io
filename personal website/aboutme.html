            Currently attending University of Waterloo, double majoring in Computational Mathematics and 
            <br><br> 
            Statistics with a minor in Computing, for a graduation goal of 2025. 
            <br><br>
            I chose this academic path to pursue my interest in data science and AI, which is why 
            <br><br>
            I opted for this degree and minor additionally to develop my coding skills.
            <br><br>
            So far during my undergrad, I've learnt programming languages such as Python, Racket, C, 
            Linux/Bash and <br><br>additionally HTML/CSS externally on my own.
            
            As Python is an essential language in data analytics and visualization, I developed my<br><br> understanding in the language by taking numerous 
            python courses.
